        <h2 id="who">Who</h2>

        <p>
          I was born in Helsinki, Finland in 1994. I'm an observer personality.
          I learn by looking, touching and doing. I love to build stuff with my
          own hands. I gravitate towards good and honest intentions. I wish to
          join communities that are like families where everyone feels they can
          be themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I was 20 I decided to teach myself how to code. I started with
          ASP NET, Ruby on Rails, React and Nodejs. After one and a half years
          of living and breathing code, I had 2 real world projects under my
          belt. My first project was a reservation web app for a local yoga
          studio. The second one was a sauna reservation web app for my parents'
          housing company. That one is still alive and in use every week.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is when I got introduced to Slush. I was the tech lead / CTO of
          Slush for three years. I learned most of my real technical skills at
          Slush.
        </p>

        <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

        <h3 id="skills-general">General</h3>

        <p>
          At Slush I led at most a seven headed team. We created several
          frontend and backend apps. We talked with customers and learned how to
          get feedback. As Slush is held once a year, we deployed our tools to
          other conferences like HEL Tech and Stockholm Tech Fest to shorten the
          feedback loop. We also utilized some tools like Hotjar and
          UsabilityHub to gain feedback and test our hypothesis.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned how to take care of my team and communicate with other
          teams. I learned a lot of respect and a lot from life.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned to design complex systems with a team. I learned a great
          deal about how people tend to use web tools.
        </p>

        <h3 id="skills-in-production">In production</h3>

        <p>
          At Slush we utilized the Google Cloud Platform to most of our
          deployments. We hosted a GraphQL API Gateway on App engine. We hosted
          some Dockerized microservices on Kubernetes. We deployed them with
          Circle CI. We used Google Cloud Pub/Sub for asynchronous service
          communication. We hosted general functionality, triggers and CRON jobs
          on Cloud Functions. We used Natural Language API to extract keywords
          of the companies attending Slush, and indexed them for excellent
          searchability through Algolia in our matchmaking tool. For data
          analysis we used Metabase with a Postgres database. Through the data
          at Slush I have also learned skills in Postgres and SQL in general.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of our apps were written with Nodejs. All frontends with Angular.
          Backends with Express and Nestjs.
        </p>

        <p>
          We used Mongodb, Postgres, Firestore, Firebase realtime database,
          Algolia, Contentful and Elasticsearch as our production databases.
        </p>

        <h3 id="skills-learning-projects">Learning projects</h3>

        <p>
          At Slush we had a concept called "Lab Tuesdays." It was dedicated time
          for learning anything we wanted. We made some stupid projects together
          just to experiment. Some tools we used: React, Flutter, Polymer,
          Stencil. We even built a project with the Twilio Voice API.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are several more languages, tools and platforms I have had the
          priviledge to learn by doing some small projects with them: Python,
          Ruby, C#, C, PHP, Laravel, Rails, Django, Svelte, Vue, Docusaurus,
          Gatsby, deployments on Now, Netlify, multiple tools on AWS, some tools
          on Azure, droplets on Digital ocean, Jenkins, Gitlab, Github actions,
          Travis, Apache Kafka, Rabbit MQ, Redis, Memcached, Neo4j and the list
          goes on.

        <h2 id="what-i-wish-to-learn">What I wish to learn</h2>

        <p>
          I wish to learn about life from good people. I wish to learn new
          collaboration skills from good teams. I wish to learn leadership from
          great leaders. I wish to learn from hard technical challenges and how
          to scale good practices in a scaling company. I wish to learn how to
          test software efficiently at scale.
